    "purpose_text": "This website is designed as an educational tool to help students and enthusiasts understand and visualize four fundamental graph algorithms: Kruskal’s, Prim’s, Dijkstra’s, and Floyd-Warshall’s algorithms. Each algorithm is presented with interactive tools, allowing users to input graph data, explore step-by-step executions, and visualize results, fostering a deeper understanding of graph theory and algorithmic problem-solving. The platform aims to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical application by offering hands-on experience with real-time graph visualizations, making complex ideas more accessible and engaging for learners of all levels.",
